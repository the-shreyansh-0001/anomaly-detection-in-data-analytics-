Anomaly Detection in Data Analytics

Python • Machine Learning • Isolation Forest • Data Preprocessing

Anomaly detection is a key technique in data analytics used to identify unusual patterns, rare events, or abnormal behaviors in datasets. These anomalies often indicate fraud, system failures, cyber-attacks, or unexpected business events.

This project implements Isolation Forest, a popular algorithm for unsupervised anomaly detection, using Python & Scikit-learn.

🚀 Project Overview

This project covers:

Loading and cleaning business/operational dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering & scaling

Applying Isolation Forest for anomaly detection

Identifying anomalies & visualizing them

Exporting results for reporting

The goal is to provide a production-ready pipeline that can be applied to real business data.
